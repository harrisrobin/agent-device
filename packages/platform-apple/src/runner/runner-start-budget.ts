 * The start runs detached under the session lock; the caller only waits for it as long as its own

 * build keeps going under the lock, and the next request for the device queues behind it and joins
 * the session it registers (#2894). Whatever the abort reason, the caller sees the same cancelled
 * request it would have seen from any later step. A start that fails after its caller left has
 * nobody to report to, so its failure is logged here.
 *
 * The two abort reasons get opposite treatment of the detached start, and the difference is the
 * whole point (#2894 vs #3177). A caller's own deadline (a bounded poll) must leave the start
 * running: it is the start the retry joins. A cancelled request means the client is gone, and the
 * start it was waiting for belongs to nobody — its spawn carried the *waiting request's*
 * cancellation signal only when that request opened the start, so a request that merely joined a
 * start another request spawned has no path to it otherwise. On cancel the waiter stops the
 * device's prep subprocesses through the same tree-kill path a session stop uses, so a timed-out
 * `open` cannot orphan a `build-for-testing` on the shared runner derived-data root where a
 * retried `open` would race it. Only builds whose owning start is detached are stopped: a build
 * still owned by an in-flight request belongs to its owner and dies through the owner's own
 * signal, never under a canceled waiter. The start itself keeps running under the lock (bounded
 * by its own budget); its build is left running only while its owner is still there to cancel it.
